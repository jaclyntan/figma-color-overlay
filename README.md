# No SVG, no problem


If you've ever run into the problem of having to recolor multiple pngs (because SVGs aren't available for whatever reason), and are often switching back and forth from PS to Figma, I feel your pain.

Which is why I created this plugin- so we can now recolor pngs right in Figma, saving you minutes of precious time.

To use:
- import your pngs 
- run the plugin
- update the hex code in the plugin modal
- click 'Colorize'
